    <h2>Top 3 most popular Jordan sneakers</h2>
<br>
    <h3>1. Air Jordan III</h3>

    <br>

    <p style="width:50%">This is it, folks. This is the one. The sneaker that catapulted the Air Jordan from just another signature line to a pop cultural phenomenon worth mythologizing, lining up for, debating over, and writing lists like this one about. The Is began writing the story, the IIs removed the Swoosh from the sides, but the III is where everything that truly makes a J a J comes into play. It’s the first Jordan designed by Tinker Hatfield, the visionary who pioneered the exposed Air bubble, dreamt up Marty McFly’s self-lacing bangers, and blessed us with eight of the top 10 sneakers below. And it’s the first Jordan to feature the Jumpman, the only corporate logo to inspire both a life-sized bronze statue and an inescapable earworm of a Drake and Future song. The design itself somehow feels retro and futuristic and totally timeless all at once, and the OG colorways gave us the elephant print that’s become a HOF-worthy sneaker culture staple.</p>

    <h3>2. Air Jordan I</h3>

    <br>

    <p style="width:50%">This is the black-and-red colorway that the NBA deemed illegal, leading Nike to pay Jordan’s fines, literally every sneaker to follow to drop in its own “bred” iteration, and, really, sneakers to turn into vectors of personal style. Its popularity has fluctuated over the years, but ever since a guy from Chicago named Kanye West started wearing them, they catapulted to the top of the Jordan list.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>3. Air Jordan XI</h3>
    <br>

    <br>

    <p style="width:50%">MJ hit his pinnacle as an athlete during the ‘90s, and the pinnacle of his sneaker line during that decade—without question—is the Air Jordan XI. Like all great Js, the XI is a seamless marriage of neck-snapping style and elite performance. Even now, that gleaming, tuxedo-aping patent leather is astonishing enough to elicit goosebumps from me, a grown man who has stared at these sneakers thousands of times over the past 25 years. And in 1995, people looked at these things like they’d just crash landed from another galaxy. The real brilliance of the patent mudguard, though, is that it wasn’t just there for the shine: because it’s lighter and less stretchy than full-grain leather, it resulted in a more explosive shoe that held your feet snugly in place. </p>
